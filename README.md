Hydrogen OS
===========

Getting Started
---------------

To get started with Android, you'll need to get
familiar with [Git and Repo](http://source.android.com/source/using-repo.html).

To initialize your local repository using the CyanogenMod trees, use a command like this:

    repo init -u https://github.com/Project-Hydrogen/manifest.git -b kk4.4.2

Then to sync up:

    repo sync

Please see the [Android Building Page](http://source.android.com/source/building-running.html) for building instructions.
